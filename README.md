# My Shop - A Simple E-commerce Frontend

This project is a simple e-commerce frontend application built with React and Vite. It demonstrates basic product listing, shopping cart functionality, and a checkout process. The application uses `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching, `react-router-dom` for routing, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Mock API calls are handled by `msw` (Mock Service Worker).
